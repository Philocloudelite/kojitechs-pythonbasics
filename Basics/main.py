## How to name your variable== avoid using python builtins to name your variable
## variables are case sensitive
## no space in between your variable === use underscore

#Data type (found in builtin functions)
# Builtin Data types
## str == text, figures all in qoutes("")
## int == numbers = (123)
## list [] == ["apple", "banana", "apple"]
## float == (12.3)
## boolean  bool == True or False
## dictionary dic{} == map = {"name": "philo", "age": 90}
## set {} == set_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} {"apple", "banan", "cherry"}
## None
